# Margins

Always try to use bottom margins or top margins. There's really not much difference between which one you choose but it's practical to choose one and stick with it.

I will try to stick with using **margin top,** because when you use margin top you change the position of element you applied styling to. When you use margin bottom, then you changed position of the element that's under the element you styled. This is only a matter of preference.
I will also try to use **margin left** instead of margin right for the same reason.
